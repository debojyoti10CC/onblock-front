# What Dharma Protocol Actually Does (Simple Version)

## 🎯 The Problem

AI trading bots need KYC (verified identity) to execute transactions on exchanges, but they can't complete KYC themselves.

## 💡 The Solution

**You rent out your verified identity to AI bots and earn money.**

---

## How It Works (4 Steps)

### 1. You Have KYC ✅
You've already verified your identity somewhere (Coinbase, Binance, etc.)

### 2. You Stake It 💰
Lock your KYC in a smart contract
- Set limits: How much bots can spend ($100-$10,000)
- Set time: How long (1 hour - 30 days)
- Earn: **15% APY** on your stake

### 3. AI Bots Rent It 🤖
Trading bots need to execute swaps on DEXs
- They pay you **$0.88 per transaction**
- You get **88%** of fees, protocol gets 12%
- Bots never see your personal data (zero-knowledge proofs)

### 4. You Control It ⚡
One-click "Kill Switch"
- Instantly revoke ALL access
- Takes less than 1 second
- You're always in control

---

## Real Example

**You stake $1,000 worth of identity:**
- Bot executes 100 swaps per day
- You earn: 100 × $0.88 = **$88/day**
- Monthly: **$2,640**
- Annual: **$31,680**
- APY: **~15%**

---

## Why This Matters

### For You:
- **Passive income** from unused KYC
- **No risk** - bots can't access your wallet
- **Full control** - revoke anytime

### For AI Bots:
- **Execute transactions** without KYC friction
- **Pay per use** - no upfront costs
- **Instant access** - no waiting for verification

### For DeFi:
- **Enables agentic commerce** - AI can trade autonomously
- **Regulatory compliant** - uses real KYC
- **Privacy preserved** - zero-knowledge proofs
