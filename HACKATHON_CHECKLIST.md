### Short Description (100 words)
```
Dharma Protocol v2.0 enables "Identity as Liquidity" - a marketplace where 
verified humans stake their KYC credentials to earn passive income (15% APY), 
while AI agents rent compliance capacity to execute regulated transactions 
autonomously. Built on Stellar/Soroban, the protocol uses zero-knowledge 
proofs to protect privacy and features an instant Kill Switch for complete 
user control. Stakers earn 88% of query fees, agents gain autonomous 
transaction capability, and protocols enable compliant agentic commerce 
without compromising user privacy.
```

### Technologies Used
- [ ] Stellar/Soroban (smart contracts)

- [ ] Next.js 14 (frontend)
- [ ] TypeScript (type safety)
